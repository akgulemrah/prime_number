# isPrimeInC

## Usage 

Please, just copy the code from the header file and paste it into your main file.

Or:
```C
#include "isprime.h"

int main(void)
{
        int num = 99;
        int res = is_prime(num);
        if (res)
                printf("%d is prime number.\n", num);
        else 
                printf("%d is not prime number.\n", num);


        return 0;
}
```

This is just simple function. You can do better than me.
